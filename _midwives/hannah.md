Womenâ€™s health and pregnancy care has long been my passion. In high school, I was poised for premed with intentions to become an OBGYN. Thankfully though, I witnessed my first home birth when I was 17, just in time to switch majors to nursing when I quickly learned that the midwifery model of care (and specifically home birth!) aligned far better with my beliefs on the kind of care women deserve in pregnancy and birth.&nbsp;

I completed my undergrad in nursing at Chamberlain Nursing University. I worked as a nurse at Central DuPage Hospital and as a birth assistant in home birth through midwifery school. I graduated with honors from Frontier University; completing the majority of my clinical hours with out of hospital midwives providing care in clients homes or birth centers.&nbsp;

My philosophy of care is centered around supporting my clients holistically. I value nutrition and movement as top priorities for good health and take a pro-metalolic approach to supporting the body before, during, and after pregnancy.&nbsp;

When I am not catching babies, I spend my time engaged in my church community, spending time with my very large family, and educating young women about their menstrual cycles, family planning, and intimacy.
