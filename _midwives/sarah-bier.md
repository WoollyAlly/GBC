Sarah embarked on a career in nurse midwifery after experiencing the loving care of nurse midwives during her first two pregnancies. During her pregnancies, she noticed that forging strong partnerships with providers and becoming actively informed in health care decision making led Sarah to feel more respected and well cared for in health care environments than in the past. She became a doula and childbirth educator and was graduated from University of Illinois at Chicago's nurse-midwifery program in 2017. She served under-resourced clients as a full scope midwife and provided primary care, mental health support, trans\* hormone therapy and sexual health care in the outpatient environment. Sarah is board certified by Postpartum Support International in Perinatal Mental Health and has extensive training in supporting clients to achieve their mental health goals. She has provided prenatal and well-woman care in rural Haiti and to refugees at the US-Mexico border. Sarah is an advocate for evidence-based practice and is excited to contribute to Chicago's premier home birth practice. A passionate advocate for reproductive justice, body autonomy, and client-centered care, Sarah is invested in providing tailored care that meets each client's priorities and needs.&nbsp;

Prior to embarking on a career in nurse midwifery, Sarah studied conflict resolution as an undergraduate at University of Illinois, Champaign, obtained a Masters of Arts in Comparative Theology from Catholic Theological Union, worked as an antipoverty and social justice community organizer, and an educator in a variety of settings across Chicagoland. This experience helped Sarah nurture skills to build trust, engage in difficult conversations, and forge partnerships with diverse community leaders and she is delighted to bring all these experiences to her work as a midwife.&nbsp;

Together with her husband, Sarah parents three rambunctious and wonderful children, all of whom were caught by midwives. When not at work, she is a dedicated Crossfitter and weightlifter, gardener and is likely to be found cooking in the kitchen. She and her family have been composting since before it was popular, have a beehive, bake their own bread and have a collection of egg-laying chickens.
