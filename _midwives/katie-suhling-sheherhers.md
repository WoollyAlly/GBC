Katie's love for birth began at age 7 after accidentally stumbling upon TLC's "A Birth Story". Her fascination for the magic of birth continued to grow from there and eventually blossomed into a passion during nursing school, where she was able to witness her first live birth with a nurse-midwife.&nbsp; After completing her bachelor's degree in nursing from Marquette University, Katie practiced as a registered nurse in the operating room in Milwaukee (the OR was her close-2nd favorite nursing specialty).&nbsp;

After gaining nearly 4 years of real-world experience as an RN, Katie felt called to go back for her graduate degree and finally become a certified nurse-midwife herself. She graduated from Georgetown University's Nurse-Midwifery and Women's Health Nurse Practitioner program in May of 2021. She was able to catch babies as a student nurse-midwife at the same hospital where she experienced her first live birth, which helped make her midwifery journey come full-circle. Katie joined Gentle Birth Care shortly after graduating and has quickly found that home birth is where she is best able to develop rich relationships with her clients and incorporate informed consent, trauma-informed care, and shared decision making into her practice as a CNM.&nbsp;

Outside of GBC, Katie loves tending to her ever-growing menagerie of plants, reading as many books as she can get her hands on, lifting heavy weights (for fun), and spending time with her family and friends.&nbsp;
