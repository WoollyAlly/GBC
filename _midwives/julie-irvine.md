Prior to my nursing education, I was an active-duty member of the US Air Force, where I trained and worked as a Chinese Crypotologic linguist. After I separated from the Air Force, I decided to attend nursing school and received my BSN with honors from the University of Illinois at Chicago.

The first birth I witnessed was as a nursing student at UIC during my Maternal Child nursing clinical. The birth was attended by a CNM and it was the most powerful thing I experienced in nursing school. I knew right then and there that I wanted to be a midwife. I worked as a labor and delivery RN in the hospital for a few years, and then went on to be a home birth assistant and earned my doula certification through DONA International. When I began midwifery school, I went back into the hospital setting for both work and clinical practice. I graduated with my MSN from Frontier Nursing University in 2018. While I am grateful for all my hospital experience, my heart has always been in home birth.

My husband David and I have three children who were all born in completely different ways. Our first son was a standard hospital vaginal birth, our daughter a C-section, and our last son was born in May 2021 at home!

When Iâ€™m not working or wrangling children, I am an avid Crossfitter and gardener. I have a large vegetable garden which I love working in every summer.
