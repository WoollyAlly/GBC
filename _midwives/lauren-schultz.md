Childbirth has always had a magnetic draw for me, especially the privilege of guiding, encouraging, and supporting laboring people through the process. I began my birth-world career as a doula in 2009. After graduating with a BA in Biblical Studies and Women’s Ministry from Moody Bible Institute, I desired to support people in a more tangible way. I worked as a labor support and postpartum doula for 5 years. I found doula work to be extremely satisfying and learned a great deal about physiologic birth, lactation, postpartum care, and herbal remedies. In addition, I developed a powerful bond with birthcare workers in the Chicagoland area as we collectively sought to support the child birthing process. While working as a doula, I decided to attend Loyola’s Niehoff School of Nursing, to receive my second bachelors; a BSN (Bachelors of Science in Nursing).

I became a registered nurse in 2013 and started working in labor and delivery, while also attending UIC for my MSN (Master of Science in Nursing) in midwifery. I worked as an L&D nurse at two different teaching hospitals in Chicago alongside some excellent OBs and midwives. My experience there confirmed my desire to become a midwife as well as educated me about different kinds of labor management, from high-risk to low-intervention. During that time I welcomed my two babies at home with a certified nurse midwife, my daughter in 2013 and my son in 2017.

I am thrilled to be working in homebirth as a CNM. I seek to support physiological birth and provide care that reaches individual families needs. Homebirth lends itself especially well to patient-centered care and I couldn’t be happier to be starting my midwife career without the constructs often found in hospital settings. I firmly believe in body autonomy, and seek to partner with families while providing safe and evidenced-based care in birth and throughout the life-cycle.
