  I first started dreaming of working with Gentle Birth Care after the beautiful
  home birth of my daughter with Hillary in 2015. Everything about my labor and
  the birth of my daughter affirmed what I had known from my midwifery work and
  listening to my clients, and I felt that joining this practice would enable me
  to become the kind of midwife I always wanted to be.

Corinne earned her Master of Science in Nursing, with preparation to become a nurse-midwife, from the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) in 2012. She completed her B.A. in English, with extensive preparation in Spanish literature, at the University of California at Berkeley, then transitioned to the nursing world through UIC's Graduate Entry Program in 2010. Prior to becoming a midwife, Corinne worked as a Registered Nurse in family planning and has long been devoted to advocacy for reproductive justice and health equity. She joined Gentle Birth Care in 2017, following several years providing full scope midwifery with underserved populations on Chicago's South Side, as well as in a hospitalist role in both a busy teaching hospital and a smaller community hospital on Chicago's West Side.&nbsp;

For Corinne, working in home birth is a perfect extension of her passion for helping women and childbearing people access the full spectrum of patient-centered reproductive health care. By recognizing and promoting the physiology of reproductive health cycles and events, while promoting current evidence-based practices, Corinne works to partner with her clients for an empowering and safe pregnancy and birth, as well as reproductive health across the lifespan. While she values the skills she gained from her previous midwifery practice in higher acuity birth settings, Corinne greatly enjoys working in a midwifery practice that puts the birthing person, rather than the medical institution, at the center of labor and birth. To Corinne, there is no greater honor as a midwife than to be invited to attend someone's birth -- to be invited do so in their home is an even greater privilege. She work to honor that trust by bringing her most compassionate and professional self to every care opportunity, especially at this most sacred time in a family's life. Beyond physiologic birth, Corinne's clinical interests include family planning, mental health, and queer and trans health.&nbsp;

On Corinne's days off, you may find her puttering in her garden (full of native plants and edibles), riding her bike around town (year round!), or on the local trails. Other than enjoying time (especially outdoors) with her kiddo (born at home with both Stephanie and Hillary with Gentle Birth Care), Corinne loves cooking, reading, writing, and good local foods.
