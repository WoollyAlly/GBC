  I became a nurse in order to work as a women's health nurse practitioner, and
  then fell in love with birth, as well as found that midwives were my people --
  and knew that I had to expand the scope of my training to include birth care.
  I completed my RN through the Graduate Entry Program at the University of
  Illinois at Chicago, then my midwifery training through the same College of
  Nursing, in 2012. During my midwifery education, I worked as a nurse in family
  planning, a field I continue to hold dear to my heart. Prior to joining Gentle
  Birth Care, I was a primary care midwife for a medically underserved community
  on Chicago's South Side, and attended births at Metro South Medical Center in
  Blue Island. I then worked as a laborist midwife at Prentice Women's Hospital
  as well as at Saint Anthony Hospital on Chicago's west side, both positions
  that allowed me to work with very talented multidisciplinary teams to provide
  a wide range of clinical midwifery services. All of my previous experience has
  given me an excellent foundation for both providing safe care in higher acuity
  birth settings and for responding to problems that can arise during a more low
  risk process. 


  I first started dreaming of working with Gentle Birth Care after the beautiful
  home birth of my daughter with Hillary in 2015. Everything about my labor and
  the birth of my daughter affirmed what I had known from my midwifery work and
  listening to my clients, and I felt that joining this practice would be what
  would enable me to become the kind of midwife I always wanted to be. I had
  known intellectually the benefits of physiologic birth, but to experience it
  was transformative personally and professionally. I have always worked to
  provide as much support as possible for normal birth to my hospital clients,
  but I knew that GBC would be the best "home" for me to both advance my skills
  and to enjoy the blessings of birth work. 


  I have long felt that the medical model of childbirth robs the birthing person
  of their innate power, and after over three years working in hospital birth, I
  was very ready to join a practice that puts the birthing person, rather than
  the medical institution, at the center of labor and birth. To me, there is no
  greater honor as a midwife than to be invited to attend someone's birth -- to
  be invited do so in their home is an even greater privilege. I work to honor
  that trust by bringing my most compassionate, professional, and evidence-based
  decision-making self to every care opportunity, especially at this most sacred
  time in a family's life. Beyond physiologic birth, my clinical interests
  include family planning, mental health, and queer and trans health. 


  I love Chicago, and on my days off, you may see me puttering in my garden
  (full of native plants and edibles), riding my bike around town (year round),
  or on the local trails (because I do have to get out of the city too). Other
  than enjoying time outdoors with my family, I love cooking, reading, and good
  local foods.

I grew up in Mississippi, and have worked primarily in Alabama and Mississippi before moving to Chicago to pursue my PhD in Nursing. I’m currently a PhD student at UIC as well as working with Gentle Birth Care.

My first real introduction to birth was when my sister was born at home. My mother didn’t want the rest of us kids to be present for the delivery, but we stayed with my grandmother and Daddy came to get us as soon as Anna Beth was born. I remember being able to crowd into my parent’s room to see the baby, and I was so excited because I finally had a sister.

The first birth I witnessed was one of my mothers’ friends; I was eleven and came along to watch the children. As babies often do, this little guy decided to make his entrance at night, so I put the children to sleep and asked if I could watch the birth. The adults let me come in, and I was entirely fascinated. I was very impressed with how calm and skilled the midwife was, and she apparently noticed how intently I was watching everything, as she called me over afterward to show me the placenta. “The tree of life” she called it, and I was amazed. That was the moment I knew exactly what I wanted to do with the rest of my life.

When I was in my teens I started assisting a local homebirth midwife, and was able to work with her through high school and college. When I started nursing school, I thought I would want to work as a Labor and Delivery nurse, but I found the hospital birth environment wasn’t a good fit for me, and discovered a passion for Pediatric Critical Care. My nursing experience was entirely Pediatric Critical Care, with cross training in Neonatal Intensive Care and Nursery

After working for about three years as a nurse, I entered the midwifery program at Vanderbilt University in Nashville, doing my clinical rotations at Fort Knox, in Kentucky, at Vanderbilt in Nashville, and at Gundersen Lutheran in LaCrosse, Wisconsin.

I worked as a midwife in Montgomery, Alabama and Meridian, Mississippi, in hospital- based practices, focused on medically underserved women and families. I treasure the years I spent there and learned so much from the midwives I worked with and the women we cared for.

When I met Hillary after moving to Chicago, I knew I had found an excellent fit. I am excited to have the opportunity to return to my homebirth roots, where I hope to help other families create those same warm, joyful, gentle memories of birth that my family shares.
