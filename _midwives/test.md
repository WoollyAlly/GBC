I became a nurse in order to work as a women's health nurse practitioner, and then fell in love with birth, as well as found that midwives were my people -- and knew that I had to expand the scope of my training to include birth care. I completed my RN through the Graduate Entry Program at the University of Illinois at Chicago, then my midwifery training through the same College of Nursing, in 2012. During my midwifery education, I worked as a nurse in family planning, a field I continue to hold dear to my heart. Prior to joining Gentle Birth Care, I was a primary care midwife for a medically underserved community on Chicago's South Side, and attended births at Metro South Medical Center in Blue Island. I then worked as a laborist midwife at Prentice Women's Hospital as well as at Saint Anthony Hospital on Chicago's west side, both positions that allowed me to work with very talented multidisciplinary teams to provide a wide range of clinical midwifery services. All of my previous experience has given me an excellent foundation for both providing safe care in higher acuity birth settings and for responding to problems that can arise during a more low risk process.&nbsp;

I first started dreaming of working with Gentle Birth Care after the beautiful home birth of my daughter with Hillary in 2015. Everything about my labor and the birth of my daughter affirmed what I had known from my midwifery work and listening to my clients, and I felt that joining this practice would be what would enable me to become the kind of midwife I always wanted to be. I had known intellectually the benefits of physiologic birth, but to experience it was transformative personally and professionally. I have always worked to provide as much support as possible for normal birth to my hospital clients, but I knew that GBC would be the best "home" for me to both advance my skills and to enjoy the blessings of birth work.&nbsp;

I have long felt that the medical model of childbirth robs the birthing person of their innate power, and after over three years working in hospital birth, I was very ready to join a practice that puts the birthing person, rather than the medical institution, at the center of labor and birth. To me, there is no greater honor as a midwife than to be invited to attend someone's birth -- to be invited do so in their home is an even greater privilege. I work to honor that trust by bringing my most compassionate, professional, and evidence-based decision-making self to every care opportunity, especially at this most sacred time in a family's life. Beyond physiologic birth, my clinical interests include family planning, mental health, and queer and trans health.&nbsp;

I love Chicago, and on my days off, you may see me puttering in my garden (full of native plants and edibles), riding my bike around town (year round), or on the local trails (because I do have to get out of the city too). Other than enjoying time outdoors with my family, I love cooking, reading, and good local foods.&nbsp;
