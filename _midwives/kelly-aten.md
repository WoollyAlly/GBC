I grew up in southern Indiana and from a very early age I knew I wanted to be in the health care field.&nbsp; I have always been fascinated with all the amazing things that our bodies are capable of!&nbsp; I remember memorizing all the bones in the body when I was in fifth grade, just for fun.&nbsp;

I graduated with my nursing degree in 2001.&nbsp; In my first nursing job, I was fortunate to work with a former home birth assistant who taught me a lot about natural birth.&nbsp; I am grateful to have worked as a registered nurse in labor & delivery and postpartum in 3 different hospitals over 8 years, which gave me a broad range of experiences.&nbsp; I also spent some time working as a doula, where I could focus my care to be individualized, and support families in a more personalized way.&nbsp; Over the years, I have grown to have a deep appreciation for what women are capable of when they are well-supported during their pregnancy and birth! &nbsp;

Eventually I found my way to home birth where I had the opportunity to work as a birth assistant for 4 years before finally becoming a nurse-midwife.&nbsp; Over the years, I have attended thousands of births in the hospital setting, and over 100 home births.&nbsp; Iâ€™ve also taught prepared childbirth classes in the hospital setting, and co-facilitated group prenatal care focusing on home birth.&nbsp; I love talking with women to develop a plan focusing on what is most important to them and their family for their birth experience!

At home, I love being a mom to my three beautiful girls, ages 7, 10 and 13.&nbsp; I am actively involved at Church of the Resurrection in Wheaton and love finding the fingerprints of God in everyday experiences.&nbsp; I also love to knit, work in my garden, and experiment in the kitchen.
