I have been a registered nurse since 2001 and have worked in labor & delivery and postpartum in 3 different hospitals over 8 years.

In my first job, I was fortunate to work with a former homebirth assistant who taught me a lot about natural birth. Frustrated, I left the hospital setting to work as a doula where I could focus all my attention on one woman at a time.

Eventually I found my way to homebirth where I have been a working birth assistant for 3 years. I have attended thousands of births in the hospital, and nearly 100 home births. I taught prepared childbirth classes in the hospital setting, and co-facilitated group prenatal care with a focus on homebirth. I love talking with women about developing a plan focused on what is important to them for their birth experience!

I am currently studying to be a nurse-midwife at Frontier Nursing University. At home, I love being a mom to my three beautiful girls, ages 5, 8 and 11
