I am from Chicago and was raised here by my mother and grandmother. I grew up in a family that was predominantly women and have always felt most comfortable in this type of setting. After graduating with a B.A. in 2005 from UIC, I had some soul searching to do. I traveled, practiced yoga, worked on a farm, and eventually decided to go back to school. Having let a fear of science classes keep me from the health care field, it was time to follow my true calling, midwifery and women’s health. It was a natural fit.

I completed a B.S. in Nursing in 2010 at Columbia University in NYC, and also completed my M.S. in Women’s Health in 2012 there. Meanwhile, I moved back to Chicago and gave birth to my daughter, Arianna, at home in 2011. I had a lovely water birth with my son, Oliver, also at home in Chicago in 2013. Having children has changed my life and enriched it in ways I never thought possible. I treasure my time with them and learn from them daily. In the fall of 2013 I went back to UIC to complete my original plan of becoming a midwife, and I started the post-masters program in midwifery. In December 2014, I completed my post-masters in midwifery from UIC.

I am very excited to be working at Gentle Birth Care as a midwife assistant and am honored to work with all the families choosing home birth. Home is where the heart is, and I cherish being part of a practice that is dedicated to making birth at home an option for so many families. Home is truly a beautiful place to give birth!
