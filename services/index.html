							<p class="editable">All visits during your pregnancy will usually take anywhere from thirty minutes to an hour, usually in my office. We will spend time talking about your physical and emotional feelings, along with discussing your plans for the pregnancy and birth. Additionally nutrition, pregnancy discomforts, and family relationships & stresses will be reviewed. <br /><br />
 	During each visit, the following will be assessed: your blood pressure, measuring the baby's growth, feeling the position of the baby, urine check, and listening to the baby's heartbeat with a doppler (or fetoscope if desired). At least one prenatal visit will be in your home around 36 weeks, this will be a birth plan visit; again reviewing your plans for the birth.</p>

							<p class="editable">One-to-one care and support is provided during labor according to the individual needs of the woman and her family. Some women enjoy hands-on support and guidance while others want solitude and independence. We take my cues from the individual families. We encourage the use of water during labor and have extensive experience in waterbirths, including one of my own births.<br /><br />&nbsp;After the birth, the birth assistant and Midwife will stay for 2-3 hours to ensure that mother and baby are stable and that breastfeeding is off to a good start. During that time we will also complete a newborn exam. We will visit the new family in their home within 24 - 48 hours and accomplish the newborn screening test. A two week visit (either in the home or my office) and a six week postpartum office visit are included.</p>
