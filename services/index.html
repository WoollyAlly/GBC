							<p class="editable">All visits during your pregnancy will usually take anywhere from thirty minutes to an hour, usually in my office. We will spend time talking about your physical and emotional feelings, along with discussing your plans for the pregnancy and birth. Additionally nutrition, pregnancy discomforts, and family relationships & stresses will be reviewed. <br><br>
 	During each visit, the following will be assessed: your blood pressure, measuring the baby's growth, feeling the position of the baby, urine check, and listening to the baby's heartbeat with a doppler (or fetoscope if desired). At least one prenatal visit will be in your home around 36 weeks, this will be a birth plan visit; again reviewing your plans for the birth.</p>
