Christina's journey into a birth worker role began in 2008 with the birth of her daughter, caught by a CNM in the hospital. The transition into motherhood, fostered by a midwife was the first experience where a medical provider treated her as an equal and trusted her and her body, building her own trust within. 3 short years later her son was caught by another CNM, at the same hospital with the support of a doula, without medication leading her to know that she could accomplish anything\!&nbsp;

It was after these collective experiences that she decided to start nursing school in 2013 unsure of the end goal, but with a fierce desire to work with pregnant and nursing people and their families.&nbsp; She graduated and started working on a postpartum floor in Chicago's west side where she saw glimpses into the true depths of the inequities that the BIPOC communities suffer, as well as where her love of supporting new parents and their families deepened. She started CNM school in 2018, knowing that her life's path was leading her to serve as a midwife. She graduated in October of 2020 and is now a CNM herself.

She has been working with GBC since June of 2019 and considers it an honor and a privilege to be a part of their patient's love, joy, sorrow, fear, tears, laughter, and a multitude of emotions that can't be put into words. Watching a person bring a human earthside always is and always will be one of her most favorite places to be. She is extremely passionate about informed consent and bodily autonomy and trusts her patient's ability to make decisions about their own medical care. When she is not assisting baby catchers, she is adventuring with her 2 beautiful kids, relaxing with friends, cooking, gardening, or even throwing some kettlebells.
