Kiyomi began working as a doula in 2009 when several of her closest friends became pregnant.&nbsp; Being present for birth was her introduction to healthcare, and left a profound and lasting impact.

She graduated with an MSN from Rush University in 2012, and has experience in emergency medicine, medical surgical nursing, and Clinical Nurse Leadership. After several years of being away from births, Kiyomi is glad to be joining GBC, and returning her focus to the care of women and their families.

She is currently studying Nurse Midwifery at Frontier Nursing University.
<br>When not working or studying, you can find Kiyomi looking at art, listening to music, cooking, and playing outside. She lives with her boyfriend in Ukrainian Village
