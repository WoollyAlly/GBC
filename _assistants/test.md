I have officially been an assistant with Gentle Birth Care since July 2014, though I also apprenticed as a student with GBC in the summer of 2012.&nbsp; I became a Registered Nurse (RN) at the University of Illinois at Chicago and I'm currently in school to become a Certified Nurse Midwife (CNM).

I love working with women and their families. I became part of the Chicago birthing community in 2009 as a birth doula and childbirth educator.&nbsp; I attended births and taught childbirth education classes to hundreds of families-to-be.&nbsp; Supporting women, and honoring their birth choices is my passion.

My previous experience includes working with moms and babies while in the Peace Corps in Guinea, West Africa, and doing non-profit medical education in Chicago.

I am the mother of two children, one born with Certified Nurse Midwives in the hospital and the other born at home with Hillary in 2010.&nbsp; In my free time, I like to read, knit, exercise, and go on adventures with my children and husband.
