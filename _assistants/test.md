In addition to being an assistant at Gentle Birth Care, I am a nursing student and have been a labor doula and childbirth educator for many years. I am the mother of two children, one born with hospital midwives and one born at home with GBC. My previous experience includes working with moms and babies in the Peace Corps in West Africa and doing non-profit medical education in Chicago.

In my free time I like to read, knit, exercise, and go on adventures with my kids.
