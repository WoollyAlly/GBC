Aimee loves working with women and their families. &nbsp;She is passionate about patient care, physiologic birth and honoring birth choices. &nbsp;She believes in educating patients thoroughly with the latest evidence-based guidelines so they can make informed decisions about their care. &nbsp;She cherishes the long-lasting relationships she forges with patients and is delighted when she is able to care for them during multiple pregnancies as well as for non-pregnancy related issues. &nbsp;

Aimee became part of the Chicago birthing community in 2009. &nbsp;As a birth doula and childbirth educator, she attended home and hospital births and taught childbirth education classes for hundreds of families-to-be. &nbsp;Aimee has been a midwife assistant with Gentle Birth Care since July 2014, though she also apprenticed as a student with GBC in the summer of 2012. &nbsp;She went to nursing school at the University of Illinois at Chicago, where she is also completing her Masters of Science, Certified Nurse Midwife degree. &nbsp;Aimeeâ€™s previous experience includes working with moms and babies while in the Peace Corps in Guinea, West Africa, and doing non-profit medical education in Chicago. &nbsp; &nbsp;

Aimee is the mother of two children, one born at home with Hillary, and the other with hospital-based midwives. &nbsp;In her free time, she likes to read, knit, exercise and go on adventures with her children and husband. &nbsp;You will often find her looking for interesting rocks and beach glass along the shores of Lake Michigan. &nbsp;

I have officially been an assistant with Gentle Birth Care since July 2014, though I also apprenticed as a student with GBC in the summer of 2012.&nbsp; I became a Registered Nurse (RN) at the University of Illinois at Chicago and I'm currently in school to become a Certified Nurse Midwife (CNM).
