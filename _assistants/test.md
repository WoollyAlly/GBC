I recently obtained my Masters of Science, Womenâ€™s Health Nurse Practitioner degree through Frontier Nursing University and I look forward to serving women and families within that role for many years to come. My previous work as a Registered Nurse has included mental health, operating room, labor & delivery and postpartum care. In my free time I enjoy exploring the city, traveling abroad, and being a foodie.&nbsp;
