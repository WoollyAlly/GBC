Sarah fell in love with birth after witnessing her younger sibling’s births and helping to deliver her own sister while she was in highschool. This spurred her desire to one day become a midwife. She started her journey in Charlotte, North Carolina where she earned her bachelors in nursing. During her college summers she spent time in South Africa conducting breastfeeding research as well as two months in Ghana working on a labor and delivery floor in Takoradi. Following graduation, she began her midwifery studies at the University of Illinois Chicago where she is completing her dual DNP in Midwifery and Women’s Health. Her love of holistic and physiologic birth made working in home birth an easy choice. Sarah joined the Gentle Birth Care team in April 2021 and loves being a part of each and every prenatal checkup, postpartum visit, and birth story that she has the honor of attending.
