Nearly 12 years ago, I was pregnant with my first child and completely clueless about how that child would make his way out. But then, fortunately, I took Bradley Method childbirth classes, switched from my hospital obstetrician to a home birth midwife, hired a doula, and had a fantastic birth--despite it taking 51 hours! It could not have gone better than it did-- but it would not have worked that way had I, and the people I was surrounded by, not had faith in my body and trust in the birthing process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

This experience sent me on the journey of a lifetime. I became a Bradley Method &reg; instructor and have taught classes to hundreds of couples over the years, helping them gain the knowledge and skills needed to have a great birth experience. Later, I became a birth doula and then a DONA-Approved Birth Doula Trainer, training hundreds of doulas and teaching them the tricks of the trade. I have been pursuing midwifery and working with Gentle Birth Care since the practice began and have loved every minute of it.

As a veteran mom of three, I took my experience with natural parenting products to the next level and opened a boutique! A Baby Naturally is located in downtown Wheaton at 130 W. Willow Avenue (at the corner of Willow and Hale) right below where Gentle Birth Care holds office on Fridays. We offer a variety of products such as comfy baby carriers and wraps, cloth diapers, essential oils, amber teething necklaces, and gifts. Along with Viatrix Health and our additional space, The Loft, we offer additional classes, chiropractic and acupuncture care, massage, and more.
