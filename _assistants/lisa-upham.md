mini_bio: 'Lisa is a Bradley Method instructor and DONA approved Birth Doula Trainer who has been with Gentle Birth Care from the start!'
---

Nearly 12 years ago, Lisa was pregnant with her first child and noted feeling clueless about how that child would make his way out. But then, fortunately, she took Bradley Method childbirth classes, switched from a hospital obstetrician to a home birth midwife, hired a doula, and had a fantastic birth–despite it taking 51 hours! It could not have gone better than it did– but it would not have worked that way had Lisa, and the people she was surrounded by, not had faith in her body and trust in the birthing process.&nbsp;&nbsp;

This experience sent Lisa on the journey of a lifetime. She became a Bradley Method &reg; instructor and has taught classes to hundreds of couples over the years, helping them gain the knowledge and skills needed to have a great birth experience. Later, Lisa became a birth doula and then a DONA-Approved Birth Doula Trainer, training hundreds of doulas and teaching them the tricks of the trade. She has been pursuing midwifery and working with Gentle Birth Care since the practice began and loved every minute of it.

As a veteran mom of three, Lisa took her experience with natural parenting products to the next level and opened a boutique! A Baby Naturally is located in downtown Wheaton at 130 W. Willow Avenue (at the corner of Willow and Hale) right below where Gentle Birth Care holds office on Fridays. They offer a variety of products such as comfy baby carriers and wraps, cloth diapers, essential oils, amber teething necklaces, and gifts. Along with Viatrix Health and The Loft, we offer additional classes, chiropractic and acupuncture care, massage, and more.
