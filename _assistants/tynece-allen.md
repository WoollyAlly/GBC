![](/uploads/img-7824.jpg)I'm Tynece, I've been an active birth worker and Placenta Encapsulation Specialist since 2018 servicing Chicago and the surrounding areas. I am currently a midwifery student on the path to becoming a licensed Certified Professional Midwife (CPM). I like to say birthwork pulled me by my feet and dragged me to my altar. For me my entire experience with birth work has been ancestral. I've always been told that I have a mothering spirit or have been the "granny" of my friend groups but it wasn't until after I birthed my daughter almost four years ago now, that I really owned what spirit has been calling for me to step into. After, my own initiation into motherhood it was then when I TRULY knew what this work took, and how to truly support mothers going though their own sacred journey. Although my birth with my daughter was powerful my son’s labor showed me that our bodies will literally hold babies in if we have any blockages. I went on to have a home birth with him but it took more work than one could imagine. I believe if you can guide a mother into herself and help her to discover the true power that has been innately within her brewing, then birth can be transformational. I like to bring a very calm, magical energy to whatever space I'm moving through. I am here to educate and empower the birthing family. I strive to keep families aware of whats going on within them by asking questions that remind them that they are in control of their own bodies and they can connect with them by understanding what is happening to them. The way that you feel about your birth matters. I believe that we must take birth back and reclaim our bodily autonomy. I believe that progress happens slowly and it can look like getting the rest you need, so be gentle with yourself.
