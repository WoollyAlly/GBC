Bobbi Jo Bush attended Ball State University in Indiana and earned a Bachelor of Science in Nursing degree in 1989. &nbsp;She and her husband moved to the Chicago area and she began working as an Oncology nurse. &nbsp;Sounds a bit dismal, but she loved working with the families during a trying time. &nbsp;However, as her family began to take shape with the addition of little ones, she realized she loved everything about pregnancy, childbirth and nursing!

So, Bobbi Jo decided to switch gears and become a labor and delivery nurse. She obtained all the proper education and started working at Delnor Hospital's Newlife Center. While at Delnor, she became interested in the importance of breastfeeding and human health and received certification as a Breastfeeding Counselor. Her family moved to the Naperville area in 2012 and she transferred to Elmhurst Hospitalâ€™s Family Birthing Center where she also currently works. In 2013, she assisted in research and development of policies which promote early maternal child bonding and successful establishment of breastfeeding for mothers delivering by Cesarean Section. &nbsp;Working with midwives at Elmhurst, she began to understand a whole new perspective of labor and childbirth. &nbsp;Bobbi Jo began looking for opportunities to work with Midwives in assisting mothers.

In the Spring of 2016, the opportunity arose and she joined the Gentle Birth Care team. &nbsp;Working as a labor and delivery nurse for the past 14 years has uncovered a passion to assist mothers and their families. She is vigilant about protecting the early hours and days of maternal child attachment and breastfeeding and believes it holds the key to thwarting many common human ailments.
