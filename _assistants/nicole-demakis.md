I began my journey into birth work in 2007, after the birth of my first child. I had a planned hospital birth with midwives and felt so empowered that I was inspired to help other families. Five months later, I became a certified postpartum and labor support doula through DONA. In 2011, I had a lovely home birth. My experience further ignited my passion for physiologic birth and patient led care. Within a few months, I was enrolled in midwifery school in Wisconsin. As a student midwife, I apprenticed with a homebirth midwife for two and a half years. I have had the privilege of attending over 400 births and supporting over 200 families during the postpartum period. Itâ€™s an honor to be invited into such a tender moment. &nbsp;

I have been an assistant with Gentle Birth Care since January 2018. In addition, I am also a childbirth educator and certified lactation counselor. Originally from Vermont, I have found a home in Chicago for over the last 15 years. When not at a birth, I enjoy spending time with my boys and our rescue pup, camping, hosting potlucks, and advocating for reproductive rights.
