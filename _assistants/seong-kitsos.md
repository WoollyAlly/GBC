I come from a home birthing family. My mom’s births were attended by Linda Graff.&nbsp; I am the oldest of five and grew up trusting birth, and seeing it as a non-medical and natural event.&nbsp; I have given birth in the hospital twice, at home on land once and at home in the water twice. Two of my beautiful home births were lovingly attended by Hillary and Lisa.

Shortly after the birth of my fourth child, I unexpectedly found myself on the path towards becoming a doula. I had just finished earning my BA in English and History and was thinking about beginning my career as an educator/editor. The universe had other plans! I was gently guided into the arms of birthwork. I completed a doula training with DONA and was shocked to realize how many people were experiencing traumatic births. I left that weekend with a fire in my heart to educate others about birth choices and promote the expectation of family centered birth. This path immediately felt so right! I began attending births and a year later, I trained with The Matrona. It validated all the things I intuitively felt about supporting birthing people and families. I am passionate about supporting people without judgement. I am passionate about home birth and helping spread the word that it is a safe option for low risk pregnancy. I am passionate about recognizing the sacredness of pregnancy, birth and the postpartum time, and making sure people feel safe, supported, and respected during this special time.&nbsp;

In 2018 I started on my journey to become a Certified Professional Midwife and passed my exam in 2023. I feel blessed to be part of the Gentle Birth Care team.
