I have been working as an RN in the Neonatal ICU since 2013. My experiences in the hospital have shown me both the good and the bad of medical intervention during labor and childbirth. So when I became pregnant with my son, we decided to have an out of hospital birth. We had a beautiful water birth at an independent birth center in Dallas, Texas. This birth was life changing for me and has given me a passion to help women have the same empowering and life changing experience!

I’m so grateful to be working at Gentle Birth Care with such an amazing group of women, and feel so honored to be apart of pregnancy and birth experiences of so many wonderful women and their families!

When I’m not at the hospital or a birth, I’m home drinking coffee with my wonderful husband and obsessing over trains and ukuleles with my dear little son.
