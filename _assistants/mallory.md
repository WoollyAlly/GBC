I have always had a passion for empowering women and families to live their best lives, and through my work with Gentle Birth Care I am privileged to do just that!&nbsp; I am currently a Certified Nurse Midwifery student at the University of Illinois at Chicago.&nbsp; My previous work as a Registered Nurse has included inpatient mental health, medical/surgical, and medical detoxification.

When not working or studying, I like to try out new recipes and restaurants with my partner.&nbsp; He and I are always searching for a good drama or NPR event.&nbsp; We both cherish our childhoods on farms in Iowa but love the variety that the big city offers!
