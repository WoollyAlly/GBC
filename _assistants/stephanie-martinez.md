My first experience with birth was witnessing the home birth of my brother and his wife's first son. After that, I was hooked and became student midwife, registered nurse, lactation consultant, and ICTC-certified Full Circle Doula.

In my work as a registered nurse, doula, lactation consultant, health educator, artist, and organizer, I have long advocated for the use of trauma-informed, holistic, and culturally sensitive frameworks that use harm reduction and anti-oppression to be inclusive to all people seeking healthier lives. I'm a native life-long resident of Chicagoâ€™s South Side, bilingual (Spanish/English), and have worked supporting people in crisis for the past 15 years.
