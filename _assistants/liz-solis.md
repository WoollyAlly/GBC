After being dissatisfied with care in my previous pregnancies, I searched for a new experience. On my journey, I found midwifery care. This opened my eyes to a more personalized care. I was empowered to take charge in my care and the decision making. The midwives partnered with me and explained the “why” behind my care. This type of care helped propel me to become a student midwife and want to provide this same type of care. At Gentle Birth Care, I am proud to empower and partner with women in their care. I am a current student at Georgetown University and my previous experience as a RN is in limited OB ultrasound. 

When I am not studying or working, I am spending time with my husband and ten children! I also love reading books, cooking, baking, and binge-watching Netflix.
