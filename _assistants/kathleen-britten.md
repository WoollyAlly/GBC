I am a Registered Nurse from the University of Illinois at Chicago, where I am pursuing a DNP in Midwifery.&nbsp; I thrive on the opportunity to take what is learned in the classroom and apply it at the bedside. My education and yoga practice has made me appreciate, even more, the well-oiled machine that our bodies are. These beliefs have instilled in me a passion for holistic and natural child birth.

Through my previous work with Planned Parenthood Generation Action and the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, I have grown a deep appreciation for patient education and advocacy. Midwifery encompasses my eagerness to build each relationship, honor wants and needs, and advocate for a happy and healthy life for each patient and family. On my days off you can find me cycling around the city, listening to music, or cozying up with a new crock pot recipe! The opportunity to empower and learn from other women is inspiring to me, and I am so excited to be a part of the Gentle Birth Care team.&nbsp;
