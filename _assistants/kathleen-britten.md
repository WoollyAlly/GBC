Kathleen is a Registered Nurse from the University of Illinois at Chicago, where she is pursuing a DNP in Midwifery. Kathleen thrives on the opportunity to take what is learned in the classroom and apply it at the bedside. Her education and yoga practice has made her appreciate, even more, the well-oiled machine that our bodies are. These beliefs have instilled in Kathleen a passion for holistic and natural child birth.

Through her previous work with Planned Parenthood Generation Action and the Shirley Ryan AbilityLab, Kathleen has grown a deep appreciation for shared decision making and advocacy. She is also currently a postpartum and labor & delivery nurse in Chicago. Midwifery encompasses an eagerness to build each relationship, honor wants and needs, and advocate for a happy and healthy life for each patient and family. On her days off you can find Kathleen cycling around the city, listening to music, or cozying up with a new crock pot recipe\! The opportunity to empower and learn from other women is inspiring, and she is so humbled to be a part of the Gentle Birth Care team.&nbsp;
