Vanessa was born at home, and grew up in a community where home birth was the norm. Her passion for birth stems as far back as she can remember, and she became a DONA trained doula at the age of 16. After attending births in all settings (hospitals, birth centers, and home), Vanessa realized how truly special homebirth midwifery is, and started her journey to become a Certified Professional Midwife in 2018. She is a firm believer in the holistic approach to evidenced-based care that midwifery offers. Vanessa also works as an Emergency Medical Technician and finds it incredibly rewarding to be involved in the wide range of care provided.

Vanessa joined the Gentle Birth Care team in May of 2021 and is honored to care for, and hold space for each client she meets. She recognizes the vulnerability and sacredness of every birth, and values making sure every client and birthing person feels safe, heard, and respected.

In her free time, Vanessa enjoys working out, cooking, and being outdoors.
