  Chenyi appreciates the midwifery model of care and the difference it can make
  in terms of women's mental and physical well-being

Chenyi's undergraduate maternity nursing clinical drew her attention to women's health. So, Chenyi began a nursing externship in a Labor and Delivery unit; but besides exploring maternity nursing, which she absolutely enjoys, the experience opened her eyes to the midwifery model of care and the difference it can make in terms of women's mental and physical well-being. Chenyi developed a strong interest towards it, and as a result, started her graduate studies in midwifery at UIC, where she also received her nursing degree in 2017. After working as a bedside nurse in critical care for 1 year, Chenyi is thrilled to join Gentle Birth Care and reconnect with evidence-based midwifery practice in a more natural and holistic way. In the meantime, she is also a part of UIC's research team, learning about mental health screening tools for women in the perinatal period.

Chenyi grew up speaking both Mandarin (Chinese) and Fuzhounese (Chinese). She moved to Chicago in high school. During her free time, she likes to stay at home and listen to calming music, just to enjoy the peaceful quiet moment.
