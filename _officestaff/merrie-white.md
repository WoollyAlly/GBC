I have been working in the medical billing industry since 2002 and with Gentle Birth Care, Inc since it's inception!  It's my pleasure to help patients understand their health insurance benefits and navigate the insurance challenges that arise! I am married for 25 years and the mother of 3 grown children.  We have 2 small dogs who we love traveling with.

If you have any questions concerning your insurance, Merrie can be reached via the Gentle Birth Care portal.  If you do not have portal access, you can get in touch with Merrie at [mj_cdm@att.net](javascript:void(location.href='mailto:'+String.fromCharCode(109,106,95,99,100,109,64,97,116,116,46,110,101,116)+'?subject=GBC%20Insurance%20Question')).
