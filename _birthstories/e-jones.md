My Birth story is in the form of a poem…it all happened so fast it seemed right 1 Hour 50 Minutes 8/31/10 2:40am A sharp pain wakes me from my slumber. Is my baby boy on his way? Sitting on the toilet, rubbing my belly, “We can do this buddy, here we go” Calling midwife, Doula, mother in law, and sister Come now! Contractions strong and quick Daddy running around cleaning the house Daughter watching me through a contraction, looking concerned Remembering why it is called labor Making the bed between contractions Propping myself up with pillows How wonderful to be HOME! People start arriving Deep breath, remembering to un-crinkle my forehead Resting between contractions Midwife “check’s” me 8cm already! Doula rubbing my arms “You’re doing great” “You’re so strong” “You can do this” Cold towel on my forehead Essential oil scent in the air “Just follow your body” Another contraction….push, push push!! He’s coming quick!!! Almost here, another push Baby boy laying on my chest, he is sleeping! Born at 4:30am 8lbs 7oz, 20 inches long Perfect eyes, perfect nose, perfect lips, perfect toes! Quiet in the house, everyone leaves the room. “We did it mama’s boy, welcome to the world!”
