With my second pregnancy I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to delivery at
home with Hillary Kieser and Gentle Birth Care., Inc. She delivered my first at the
hospital in the ABC room of West Suburban Hospital. While that was a great experience
for me; growing up my mom owned a home birth practice and I always wanted to have
my babies at home. Hillary met with my husband, Mike, to address his concerns and he
quickly agreed to the homebirth provided we could have a very intimate, private home
experience. We agreed that it would just be us and the midwives attending the birth. We
had a water birth in the hospital and also hoped to have another at home.
I began laboring at about 9:00 pm March 11. My husband walked with me through
contractions, applied pressure to my back when needed, and kept track of the timing of
contractions so I could focus on relaxing. We called Hillary at about 2 am and when she
arrived I was already 6cm and fully effaced. I had been laboring in the shower and
decided I was ready for the tub. The warm water was wonderful but slowed my
contractions. I was ready to meet my baby so out of the tub I climbed. After a bit, I
decided I really wanted in the tub and was ready to start pushing. I pushed for a while
against the bag of waters which hadn’t ruptured and asked Hillary to break my water for
me. I pushed more and was beginning to feel very frustrated and tired. Hillary
encouraged me to give on more big push as she held back a cervical lip. The baby’s head
finally made some progress and Annalyn Rose was born with the next contraction at 6:45
am. Mike and I reached down together and caught our daughter lifting her up to cuddle
with me while Mike cut the cord.
One of the best parts of my home birth came when I climbed into my bed and started
nursing my baby. My 2 year old son wandered upstairs from his breakfast, still in his
pajamas. He got into to bed too and he cuddled with his mom, dad, and new sister.
Hillary Kieser allowed us to be in control of our birth while providing excellent support
and encouragement.
